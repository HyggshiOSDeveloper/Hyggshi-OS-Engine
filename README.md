**Hyggshi OS Engine** is a powerful framework built in **Roblox Studio** that lets developers create fully interactive operating system simulations inside Roblox games.
It provides flexible modules, UI tools, and system utilities to make your own in-game OS come alive.

---

## Features

* **Modular system** — plug-and-play components for apps and services
* **Custom UI** — build windows, menus, and taskbars easily
* **Lightweight** — optimized for Roblox performance
* **Extensible** — designed to be embedded into other code modules

---

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Import the **Hyggshi OS Engine** folder into your Roblox Studio project.
3. Place the **ModuleScript** named `HyggshiOSEngine` inside `ReplicatedStorage`.
4. Require it in your main script:

   ```lua
   -- Example usage
   -- Make sure "HyggshiOSEngine" is a ModuleScript inside ReplicatedStorage

   local Engine = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("HyggshiOSEngine"))
   Engine:Boot("Hyggshi OS")
   ```

---

## Usage

You can build your own apps using LuaU modules and connect them directly to the engine.

```lua
local App = {}
function App:Open()
	print("Launching MyApp inside Hyggshi OS...")
end
return App
```

---

## Purpose

> To be an engine used to embed into code modules and power OS-like experiences in Roblox.

---

## Common Errors

### Error:

```
Attempted to call require with invalid argument(s).
```

**Cause:**
You’re trying to `require` a folder, model, or missing object instead of a ModuleScript.

**Fix:**

* Ensure `HyggshiOSEngine` is a **ModuleScript**, not a folder.
* Check the path:

  ```lua
  print(game.ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("HyggshiOSEngine"))
  ```

  If it prints `nil`, move or rename your module correctly.
